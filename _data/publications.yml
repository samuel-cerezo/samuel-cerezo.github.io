  title: "SLAM&Render: A Benchmark for the Intersection Between Neural Rendering, Gaussian Splatting and SLAM"
  venue: Submitted to RA-L, 2025
  description: "A novel dataset designed to benchmark methods in the intersection between SLAM and novel view rendering. It consists of 40 sequences with synchronized RGB, depth, IMU, robot kinematic data, and ground-truth pose streams"
