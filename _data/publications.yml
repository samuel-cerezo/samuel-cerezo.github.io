  title: "GNSS-Inertial State Initialization Using Inter-Epoch Baseline Residuals"
  venue: RA-L, 2025
  description: "A novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is available to accurately estimate the state of a sensorized device. To determine the optimal moment for switching from relative to global measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian matrix singular values"

  title: "An Efficient Closed-Form Solution to Full Visual-Inertial State Initialization"
  venue: Submitted to RA-L, 2025
  description: "A new analytical solution that is easy to implement and robust at initialization, thanks to the small-rotation and constant-velocity approximations, which simplify the problem while preserving the essential coupling between motion and inertial measurements."
